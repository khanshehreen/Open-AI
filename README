# Open-AI Text Summarizer

A Python project to extract and summarize insights from a PDF manuscript using OpenAI's GPT models. This project reads a PDF, uses custom prompts, and generates topic-focused summaries.

---

## Features

- Extracts text from a PDF (`naval.pdf`) within a specific page range.
- Uses modular prompts defined in `prompts.py` to guide summarization.
- Generates summaries related to a specific topic (default: `life`) using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo.
- Prints a concise summary of the content.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- `openai` → Interact with OpenAI API
- `PyPDF2` → Read PDF files
- `python-dotenv` → Load environment variables from `.env`

Install these libraries using:

```bash
pip install openai PyPDF2 python-dotenv

Configuration

Create a .env file in the root directory containing your OpenAI API key:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here


Place naval.pdf in the repository root (or update the file_path in main.py).

Usage

Run the main script:

python main.py


The script will:

Extract text from the PDF

Generate a prompt based on prompts.py

Use OpenAI API to summarize the content

Print the summary to the console

Customization

Topic: Change the topic variable in main.py to summarize a different topic.

Page Range: Update start_page and end_page in main.py to summarize different sections of the PDF.

Model Settings: Modify temperature and max_tokens in main.py to adjust output style and length.

Notes

Do not commit .env or secret keys.

Keep PDFs confidential if this repo is public.
